Class Constants:
It is possible to define constant values on a per-class basis remaining the same and unchangeable.
Constants differ from normal variables in that you don't use the $ symbol to declare or use them.
The default visibility of class constants is public.

The value must be a constant expression, not (for example) a variable, a property, or a function call.

It's also possible for interfaces to have constants. Look at the interface documentation for examples.

As of PHP 5.3.0, it's possible to reference the class using a variable.
The variable's value can not be a keyword (e.g. self, parent and static).

Note that class constants are allocated once per class, and not for each class instance.
